# "Analyzing Churn Prediction Dataset and Prediction of Customer Behaviour"
This project focuses on building and comparing predictive models for customer churn using various machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). By developing and optimizing these models, we aim to identify the most accurate approach for predicting customer churn and provide valuable insights to help businesses take proactive measures to retain their customers.

## Features
- Exploratory data analysis
- Data Cleaning
- Data visualization
- Data preprocessing
- Implementation of multiple machine learning algorithms:
  - Naive Bayes
  - Decision Tree
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Comparative analysis of model performance.
- Optimization techniques to enhance accuracy and reduce errors.

## Motivation
Customer churn is a critical challenge for many businesses. Accurately predicting which customers are likely to leave helps businesses take proactive measures to retain them. This project provides insights into the effectiveness of various machine learning models for this task and aims to identify the most suitable approach.

## Dataset 
The dataset used for this project includes features related to customer behavior and demographics. It serves as the basis for training, testing, and evaluating our predictive models. 
It contains information about bank customers and their churn status, which indicates whether they have exited the bank or not.

## Dataset Features
  **CreditScore**: Customer's credit score.  
  **Geography**: Country where the customer resides.  
  **Gender**: Male or Female.  
  **Age**: Customer's age.  
  **Tenure**: Number of years the customer has been with the bank.  
  **Balance**: Account balance.  
  **NumOfProducts**: Number of products the customer has subscribed to.  
  **HasCrCard**: Whether the customer has a credit card (1 = Yes, 0 = No).  
  **IsActiveMember**: Whether the customer is an active member (1 = Yes, 0 = No).  
  **EstimatedSalary**: Customer's estimated salary.  
  **Exited**: Target variable (1 = Customer exited, 0 = Customer stayed).
